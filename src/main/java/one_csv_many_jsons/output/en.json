Individuals are either; optimistic, pessimistic, trusting, and/or envious.Of the four types, envious is the most common, with 30 percent compared to 20 percent for each of the other groups. Unlike Myers-Briggs, this temperament theory has its roots in the ancient four humors theory.A more common and widely accepted explanation of personality types is the four temperament theory. A proto-psychological (the study of human psychology) theory which suggests four fundamental personality types: sanguine, choleric, melancholic, and phlegmatic. These were associated with the domination of various biological functions. These temperaments come to the most obvious manifestation in childhood, between 6 and 14 years of age, after which they become subordinate (in most cases).",
